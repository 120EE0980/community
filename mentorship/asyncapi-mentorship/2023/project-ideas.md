2 | [Website UI Kit design/dev project](https://github.com/asyncapi-archived-repos/design-system/issues/4) | [design-system](https://github.com/asyncapi-archived-repos/design-system) | [AceTheCreator](https://github.com/AceTheCreator) | There are a lot of places where components need to be created for even the smallest of elements that repeat on the website.
3 | [MVP integration of extensions catalog with AsyncAPI tools](https://github.com/asyncapi/extensions-catalog/issues/78) | [extensions-catalog](https://github.com/asyncapi/extensions-catalog) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) | People use extensions and we should support at least the official ones in our tools.
4 | [Documenting how different protocols work with AsyncAPI](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/533) | Documentation | [Alejandra Quetzalli](https://github.com/alequetzalli) |Community uses diff protocols, because everyone has diverse needs. To get more tutorials with different protocol setups. 
5 | [Rewrite this template and NodeJS WS template](https://github.com/asyncapi/nodejs-template/issues/133) | [nodejs-template](https://github.com/asyncapi/nodejs-template) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) | [nodejs-template](https://github.com/asyncapi/nodejs-template) and also [nodejs-ws-template](https://github.com/asyncapi/nodejs-ws-template) are writing with old [Nunjucks templating engine](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#nunjucks). We need to rewrite them to [React templating engile](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#react-1) that should become the default and only engine in the future.
6 | [Simulator Desktop Application](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/691) | [simulator](https://github.com/asyncapi/simulator) | [Nektarios Fifes](https://github.com/NektariosFifes) |To turn the cli application into a full desktop application that aims to visualize an asyncApi file and allow the user to generate traffic in an interactive way.
